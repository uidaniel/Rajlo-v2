/**
 * Capacitor config for the Rajlo Driver native shell.
 *
 * This wraps the existing Next.js web app in a thin native container
 * so we can:
 *   - Stream GPS reliably in the background (the killer feature —
 *     browser geolocation pauses when the phone screen locks).
 *   - Deliver native push notifications for new ride requests.
 *   - Show in the app stores.
 *
 * Architecture: the native app is a WebView that loads the live
 * driver portal (`server.url`) at startup. All of the existing
 * Next.js code — pages, API routes, auth, proxy — runs on the same
 * server. The native layer only kicks in for background GPS + push.
 *
 * The bundled webDir (`capacitor-shell/`) is shown if the remote URL
 * fails to load (rare — usually only when offline at first launch).
