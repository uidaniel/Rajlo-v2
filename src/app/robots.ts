/**
 * Dynamic robots.txt.
 *
 * Two regimes depending on the host the request came in on:
 *
 *   - **Production (rajlo.com / www.rajlo.com)** — normal SEO rules.
 *     Public marketing pages are crawlable; auth-gated portals
 *     (/rider, /driver, /admin, /api, /auth, /trip share-links) are
 *     disallowed because Googlebot can't sign in, and indexing those
 *     creates dead-end results.
 *
 *   - **Anywhere else (rajlo-v2.vercel.app preview, *.vercel.app
 *     branch previews, ngrok dev tunnels, localhost)** — fully
 *     disallowed. We absolutely do NOT want Google to index the
 *     preview URL: if it did, on launch day rajlo.com would compete
 *     with rajlo-v2.vercel.app for the same content and lose ranking
 *     signals to duplicate content. The host check + Disallow: / is
 *     the canonical fix.
 *
 * Both regimes still point Sitemap: at the production URL so an
 * accidentally-fetched preview robots.txt doesn't poison Google's
 * sitemap cache. Once DNS is live, the preview file becomes
 * irrelevant.
