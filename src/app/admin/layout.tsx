 * officers need access to the safety queue + live trips, which live
 * under /admin/* alongside the full ops console. We branch on the
 * authenticated user's profile.role so officers only see the scoped
 * nav (Safety + Live trips) and don't even render the rest of the
 * admin sidebar that they wouldn't have permission for at the API
 * layer anyway.
 *
 * Anyone else hitting /admin gets bounced to /sign-in (no auth) or
 * the rider dashboard (signed in but wrong role).
