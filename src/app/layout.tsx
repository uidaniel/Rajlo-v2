/**
 * Brand fonts (per Rajlo Brand Guidelines, Sept 2024):
 *   - Primary:   Avenir   (Light, Book, Roman, Medium, Heavy, Black)
 *   - Secondary: Kollectif (Regular, Bold)
 *
 * Both are paid/proprietary fonts not available on Google Fonts. The brand
 * book (p.35) explicitly authorizes a similar Avenir-style substitute when
 * the real font isn't available — we use Inter as the primary fallback and
 * DM Sans as the secondary fallback.
 *
 * To switch to real Avenir + Kollectif:
 *   1. Drop self-hosted .woff2 files in /public/fonts/ (Adobe Fonts kit, etc.)
 *   2. Uncomment the @font-face block in globals.css
 *   3. Replace `--font-primary` and `--font-secondary` here with the local refs

 * Explicit viewport config — fixes the iOS Safari "page loads zoomed
 * in" symptom. Without this, Safari falls back to a 980px viewport
 * heuristic + scales to fit, which renders Rajlo at ~50% zoom and
 * forces the user to pinch out manually on every page load.
 *
 * Settings:
 *  - `width: device-width` ties the layout viewport to the actual
 *    device width.
 *  - `initialScale: 1` opens at 100% zoom every time.
 *  - We deliberately DON'T set `userScalable: false` or
 *    `maximumScale: 1` — accessibility users with low vision still
 *    need pinch-to-zoom. The font-size: 16px rule on inputs in
 *    globals.css already prevents the auto-zoom-on-focus annoyance.
 *  - `viewportFit: cover` lets us paint behind the iPhone's
 *    notch / dynamic island; pages opt into safe-area insets where
 *    needed (the chat sheet "Cancel" pill already does).
 *  - Theme colour is duplicated here so the iOS / Android status
 *    bar tints brand-red when Rajlo opens from the home screen.
