/**
 * Fleet visibility — the "see nearby drivers on the booking screen" feature.
 *
 * Architecture (mirrors `use-ride-position.ts`):
 *   - Drivers who toggle online broadcast their position to a single global
 *     Supabase Realtime channel: `fleet:online`. No DB writes — broadcast
 *     fan-out is ephemeral by design.
 *   - Riders on the booking screen subscribe to that channel, maintain a
 *     Map<driverId, position>, prune entries whose last ping is older than
 *     STALE_AFTER_MS, and render a car icon for each remaining one.
 *
 * Why one global channel? Jamaica has a few thousand active drivers tops at
 * MVP scale — totally fine. Once we cross ~1k concurrent drivers, shard by
 * parish (e.g. `fleet:online:kingston`) so each rider only subscribes to
 * the slice of the country they care about.
 *
 * Privacy: we send `driverId` (UUID, not name) so subscribers can dedupe a
 * driver's pings into a single moving marker. Riders don't see who the
 * driver is — only that "a driver is here". Once a rider matches with a
 * driver, the rider gets that driver's full profile via the ride record.
